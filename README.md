- This project is a complete, end-to-end IoT system that uses an NVIDIA Jetson Nano for real-time human detection at the edge and a decoupled, event-driven cloud backend on AWS to process events and send real-time SMS alerts.
- The backend is built with Java Spring Boot and containerized with Docker, featuring a full CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and packaging.

## **System Architecture**
- The application is designed with a modern, microservices-style architecture that is scalable and resilient.

- **Edge Device (NVIDIA Jetson Nano):** A Python script runs a YOLO model to detect humans. Upon detection, it captures an image and sends it to the cloud backend's REST API.

- **Spring Boot API:** Receives the image, uploads it to an S3 bucket for storage, and publishes an event message to an SQS queue.

- **Listener Service:** An independent component listens to the SQS queue. When a message arrives, it processes the detection data, saves it to a DynamoDB table, and triggers an alert.

- **Alerting:** The system uses AWS SNS to send an immediate SMS notification to a configured phone number.

## **Key Features** 
- **Real-Time Edge AI:** Performs human detection on a low-power NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano device.

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Uses AWS SQS to decouple the API from backend processing, ensuring no data is lost and improving system resilience.

- **Scalable Cloud Backend:** Built with Java Spring Boot and designed to handle a high throughput of detection events.

- **Automated Alerts:** Instantly notifies the user via SMS upon a new detection.

- **Secure by Design:** Implements least-privilege access using specific IAM policies and securely manages credentials using environment variables and GitHub Secrets (no hard-coded keys).

- **CI/CD Automation:** Includes a full GitHub Actions workflow to automatically test, build, and package the application into a Docker container.

- **Web Dashboard:** A simple, secure dashboard to view the 20 most recent detection events.

## **Technology Stack**

- ### **Hardware & Edge Computing:**

  - NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano

  - Python, Optimized YOLO Model

- ### **Cloud & DevOps (AWS):**

  - **AWS Services:** S3, SQS, DynamoDB, IAM, SNS

  - **Containerization:** Docker

  - **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

  - **Build Tool:** Maven

- ### **Backend & Databases:**

  - Frameworks: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security

  - Architecture: REST APIs, Event-Driven Systems, Microservices

  - Databases: NoSQL (DynamoDB)

- ### **Alerting:**

  - AWS SNS / Twilio API

### **Setup and Installation Prerequisites**

  - Java 21

  - Apache Maven

  - Docker Desktop

  - An AWS account with configured credentials


- ### **1. Configure the Backend**

   - Clone the repository:
```
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd jetson-dashboard
```
   - Create an application.properties file in src/main/resources/ with the following content. The application is designed to pull sensitive credentials from environment variables.
```
    # application's name
    spring.application.name=my-detection-app
    
    # AWS Configuration
    aws.region=us-east-1
    aws.s3.bucket-name=<your-s3-bucket-name>
    aws.dynamodb.table-name=Detections
    aws.sqs.queue-name=image-processing-queue
```
    
- ### **2. Running with Docker (Recommended)**

   - This is the easiest way to run the application, as the environment is completely self-contained.

   - Build the Docker image:
    ```
      docker build -t your-username/jetson-alarm .
    ```
    
   - Run the Docker container:
     - Provide your credentials as environment variables.
```
      docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
      -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY" \
      -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY" \
      your-username/jetson-alarm
```
### **3. Running from IDE (e.g., NetBeans)**

 - Open the project in your IDE.

 - Configure the environment variables for your Run Configuration as described in previous steps (Project Properties -> Run -> Environment).

 - Click "Run Project".

### **API Usage**

  - Image Upload

  - **Endpoint:** POST /api/upload

  - **Request Type:** multipart/form-data

  - **Field Name:** file

  - **Description:** The endpoint for the Jetson Nano (or any client) to upload a detection image.

  - **Success Response:** HTTP 202 Accepted

### **Future Improvements**

- This project serves as a strong foundation for a production-grade system. Future enhancements could include:

   - **Comprehensive Integration Testing:** Using Testcontainers to validate the full application flow in the CI/CD pipeline.

   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Defining all AWS resources (S3, SQS, etc.) in code using AWS CDK or Terraform.

   - **Enhanced Observability:** Integrating Spring Boot Actuator with Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application metrics and health.

   - **Deployment to AWS:** Deploying the container to a service like AWS App Runner or ECS for a live, scalable production environment.
