- This project is a complete, end-to-end IoT system that uses an NVIDIA Jetson Nano for real-time human detection at the edge and a decoupled, event-driven cloud backend on AWS to process events and send real-time SMS alerts.
- The backend is built with Java Spring Boot and containerized with Docker, featuring a full CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and packaging.
